# üé¨ Academy Awards Analysis

**Author**: Judd Jacobs

**Project Repository**: <https://github.com/judd-jacobs/code-you-capstone>

## Project Overview

This project analyzes historical trends in **Academy Award-winning movies**, exploring patterns in genres, box office success, and award distribution. Using **Wikipedia web scraping** and **Kaggle datasets**, we collect and process Oscar-related data, store it in an **SQLite database**, and generate insights using **SQL and Python visualizations**.

This project combines **data extraction, SQL querying, data visualization, and natural language processing techniques** (**stretch goal**) to provide an engaging exploration of Oscar history.

## Features & Visualizations

- Genre Trends: Bar charts showing Best Picture winners by genre.
- Box Office & Awards: Scatter plots for revenue vs. award wins.
- Time-Based Analysis: A timeline of winning genres.
- Stretch Goal: Word Cloud from Wikipedia movie summaries (if feasible).

## Data Sources

- **Wikipedia Scraping**: Best Picture winners and movie metadata.
- **Kaggle Dataset**: Oscar awards data from various categories.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (pandas, BeautifulSoup, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud)
- **SQLite** (SQLAlchemy for structured queries)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for analysis & visualization)
- **GitHub** (for version control)
