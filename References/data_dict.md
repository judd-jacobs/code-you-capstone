A **data dictionary** provides a detailed description of the data, including the meaning, relationships, and constraints of the variables (or fields) within a dataset or database. Here’s an example of a simple data dictionary for a fictional employee dataset:

### **Explanation of Fields:**

* **`employee_id`**: A unique number assigned to each employee for identification.  
* **`first_name`** and **`last_name`**: Self-explanatory; used for storing the employee’s name.  
* **`date_of_birth`**: Stores the employee's date of birth, which is essential for age-related calculations.  
* **`email`**: Used to store the employee's contact email, which must be unique to avoid duplicates.  
* **`department`**: Identifies the department where the employee works (e.g., Marketing, HR, etc.).  
* **`salary`**: The annual salary, which should be a positive decimal number.  
* **`hire_date`**: The date the employee started working at the company.  
* **`is_active`**: A boolean field to track whether the employee is still with the company.  
* **`manager_id`**: Foreign key referencing another employee (the manager), creating a relationship between employees and their managers.
