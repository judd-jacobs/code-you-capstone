    "- Total box office revenue for nominees has steadily increased over the decades, peaking in the 2010s. However, the 2020s show a significant drop, possibly due to pandemic-era disruptions and changing viewing habits.\n",

    "**üéüÔ∏è Popular doesn't always mean profitable:**\n",

    "\n",
    "**üï∞Ô∏è Runtime doesn‚Äôt predict success:**\n",
    "- The scatterplot of runtime vs. revenue shows that both short and long films can do well ‚Äî or flop. There‚Äôs no clear sweet spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**üé≠ Drama reigns supreme:**\n",
    "- Across every genre analysis, **Drama** consistently appears as the most dominant genre among nominees and winners.\n",
    "\n",
    "**üìà Genre shifts over time:**\n",
    "- Genres like **Romance**, **Comedy**, and **War** were more common in earlier decades, while **Adventure**, **Thriller**, and **Fantasy** have gained ground in more recent years.\n",
    "\n",
    "**üé¨ Critical darlings vs. crowd favorites:**\n",
    "- The highest-rated films on IMDb tend to be sweeping epics (*The Godfather*, *Return of the King*) ‚Äî and a mix of winners and iconic non-winners (*Pulp Fiction*, *The Dark Knight*).\n",

    "This project has been more than just an analysis of Oscar data ‚Äî it‚Äôs been a celebration of the films that shape our culture, spark our imaginations, and stay with us long after the credits roll. From box office giants like *Avatar* and *Top Gun: Maverick* to genre-defining favorites like *The Godfather* and *Schindler‚Äôs List*, each visualization helped uncover a different side of the story behind Hollywood‚Äôs most prestigious award.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data journey combined storytelling, technical analysis, and a love of cinema. Data was scraped, cleaned, merged, and visualized ‚Äî weaving together multiple data sources (Wikipedia, TMDb, OMDb) to create a comprehensive look at what makes an Oscar-worthy film.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether a fan of fantasy epics, historical dramas, or heartfelt animated tales, the Academy Awards offer a lens through which we can appreciate the evolution of storytelling itself. And just like in the movies ‚Äî it‚Äôs not always about who wins in the end, but the journey we take to get there.\n",
