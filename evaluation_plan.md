# Evaluating the Success of the Academy Awards Analysis Project

To determine whether the project has achieved its goals, we need to establish **clear success criteria** across multiple areas: **technical performance, analytical insights, usability, and completeness**. Below are the key ways to evaluate the success of the project:

## **1. Data Quality & Completeness**  

**Success Criteria:**  

- [ ] The dataset contains **comprehensive** and **accurate** information about Academy Award-winning films, including genres, box office performance, and IMDb ratings.  
- [ ] Missing values have been **appropriately handled** (e.g., through imputation or data merging).  
- [ ] Speech transcripts have been **preprocessed correctly** for NLP analysis (e.g., stopword removal, tokenization).  

**How to Evaluate:**  

- [ ] Perform **data validation checks** to confirm there are no missing key fields (e.g., every Best Picture winner should have an associated genre).  
- [ ] Cross-check a sample of movies with external sources (e.g., IMDb, Wikipedia) to verify accuracy.  

## **2. SQL Query Performance & Accuracy**  

**Success Criteria:**  

- [ ] SQL queries correctly extract meaningful insights (e.g., top-winning genres, box office correlations).  
- [ ] Queries run efficiently without excessive processing time.  

**How to Evaluate:**  

- [ ] Test all **SQL queries** by running them multiple times and checking the output for correctness.  
- [ ] Use **EXPLAIN ANALYZE** in SQL to measure query performance and optimize where necessary.  

## **3. Visualization Clarity & Interpretability**  

**Success Criteria:**  

- [ ] Charts and graphs provide **clear** and **meaningful** insights.  
- [ ] Visualizations are **properly labeled**, including axes, legends, and annotations.  
- [ ] The word cloud effectively highlights key themes from acceptance speeches.  

**How to Evaluate:**  

- [ ] **Peer review:** Ask someone unfamiliar with the project to interpret the chartsâ€”if they understand the insights, the visualizations are successful.  
- [ ] **Compare trends** from the visualizations with known Oscar history (e.g., Do drama films win more often? Does box office success correlate with Oscar wins?).  

## **4. Insightful Findings & Analysis**  

**Success Criteria:**  

- [ ] The project provides **new insights** about Oscar-winning trends (e.g., which genres dominate, changes over time).  
- [ ] Acceptance speech analysis **reveals common themes** and how they have evolved.  
- [ ] The analysis **answers the key research questions** outlined in the project plan.  

**How to Evaluate:**  

- [ ] Write a **conclusion section** summarizing the key takeaways.  
- [ ] Compare findings with prior research or expectations (e.g., Do higher-grossing movies tend to win Oscars?).  

## **5. Code Organization & Documentation**  

**Success Criteria:**  

- [ ] The Jupyter Notebook is **well-structured**, with clear markdown explanations for each step.  
- [ ] The **README file** provides complete instructions for running the project.  
- [ ] Code is **well-commented**, making it easy to understand and modify.  

**How to Evaluate:**  

- [ ] Run through the Jupyter Notebook **step by step** to ensure all code executes correctly.  
- [ ] Have a **peer or mentor** review the code and documentation for clarity.  

## **6. Reproducibility & Deployment Readiness**  

**Success Criteria:**  

- [ ] The project runs successfully on a different machine with the same environment.  
- [ ] All dependencies are correctly listed in **requirements.txt**.  
- [ ] The SQLite database is properly set up and accessible.  

**How to Evaluate:**  

- [ ] Clone the GitHub repository on a different machine and follow the **installation steps**â€”if everything runs smoothly, the project is reproducible.  
- [ ] Check for any **missing dependencies** or broken paths.  

## **7. Timely Completion & Submission**  

**Success Criteria:**  

- [ ] All tasks are completed **before the deadline** (March 28, 2025).  
- [ ] The final submission includes **all necessary components** (code, dataset, README, visualizations).  

**How to Evaluate:**  

- [ ] Check the **final project timeline** to confirm all milestones were met.  
- [ ] Perform a **final checklist review** before submission.  

## **Final Thoughts on Evaluating Success**  

A successful project should:  
Deliver **clean, structured data** that provides meaningful insights.  
Include **SQL queries and Python analysis** that accurately extract trends.  
Present findings through **clear and engaging visualizations**.  
Be **well-documented and easy to reproduce**.  
Be **submitted on time** with all required materials.  

By using these evaluation criteria, we can ensure that the **Academy Awards Analysis** project meets expectations and provides valuable insights! ðŸŽ¬âœ¨
